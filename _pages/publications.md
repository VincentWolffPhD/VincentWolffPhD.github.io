We argue that incentives to take equity risk (”equity incentives”) only partially capture incentives to take asset risk (“asset incentives”). This is because leverage, while central to the theory of risk-shifting, is not explicitly considered by equity incentives. Employing measures of asset incentives that account for leverage, we find that asset risk-taking incentives can be large compared to incentives to increase firm value. Stock holdings can induce substantial risk-taking incentives, contrary to the assumption that only stock options drive risk-taking. Finally, asset incentives help explain asset risk-taking of U.S. financial institutions before the 2007/08 crisis.

[Spillovers to exchange rates from monetary and macroeconomic communications events](https://www.snb.ch/en/publications/research/working-papers/2020/working_paper_2020_18) — Vincent Wolff, [Enzo Rossi](https://cepr.org/about/people/enzo-rossi), Swiss National Bank Working Paper Series, 2020.

We study the tightness of the link between U.S. monetary and macroeconomic communication events and the exchange rate movements against the USD of four major currencies - the euro, the Swiss franc, the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso - since the global financial crisis (GFC). We find three main results. Approximately 20 percent of the U.S. communications events were associated with statistically significant exchange rate effects. Unconventional and conventional monetary policy announcements had equal impacts. The reactions of the advanced countries' currencies were more in line with each another than with those of the emerging markets' currencies.

This book offers a comprehensive exploration of financial derivatives and their systemic implications within modern financial markets. Bridging theoretical rigor with real-world relevance, it examines the structure, function, and valuation of key derivative instruments—including forwards, futures, swaps, options and other derivatives—while addressing the risks they pose to economic stability. By situating derivative markets within the broader context of asset pricing and financial intermediation, the text enables readers to grasp both their utility and their potential for dysfunction. Combining analytical depth with critical reflection, it provides scholars, practitioners, and policymakers with an integrated understanding of derivatives’ role in contemporary finance.

## Chapters

Chapter: [Foreign exchange swaps and cross-currency swaps](https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/elgeechap/20173_5f20.htm) in the book: [Research Handbook of Financial Markets](https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/elgeebook/20173.htm) —

The foreign exchange (FX) swap market is the largest financial market in the world and yet we do not know it thoroughly. To understand it better, we first explain the main characteristics of FX swap and cross-currency swap contracts. We emphasize the importance of the valuation adjustment (XVA) approach and then map the FX swap market in terms of currencies, parties, maturities, and size. Second, we discuss the institutional framework of the FX swap market, specifically its global over-the-counter (OTC) and two-tier structure in which dealers play a dominant role and deal with a highly diverse client base. Third, we review the recent technological trends including electronification, and policy actions such as the regulatory reform and process to oust the Libor rate. We conclude this paper by pointing to future research directions to better understand the pricing and market functioning of FX swaps.
