[Taxing Financial Transactions in Multiple Markets](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4612809) —

What are the effects of taxing stock and derivative transactions on market liquidity and welfare? My theoretical model predicts asymmetric responses to equivalent tax rates across markets, resulting in welfare improvements upon taxation. Stock volume decreases significantly relative to options volume, and liquidity improves in the taxed market due to reduced adverse selection. I causally test the model’s predictions by leveraging three separate FTT introductions on stocks and derivatives. Empirical results show reduced trading in the taxed markets and migration of informed trading to the untaxed market. I reject the common conception that the synthetic replication of stocks is a practiced alternative to avoid the tax.

Næs, Skjeltorp, and Ødegaard (2011) provide empirical evidence that stock market liquidity contains leading information about future economic activity. Their result suggests a rebalancing of small, increasingly illiquid to large stocks in recession times, an expression of “flight-to-quality”. We show that the relationship no longer holds due to the Fed’s accommodative monetary policy to buoy stock markets in crisis starting in the 1990s. Moreover, we document that liquidity dry-ups in small stocks no longer coincide with recessions. The Fed’s interventions mute the systematic link between monetary conditions and aggregate stock market liquidity’s well-established business cycle component.

[Empirical Causal Asset Pricing with Trading Costs]() — 
Vincent Wolff, 
[Luca Gaeaguf](https://app.9am.works/talent/luca-gaegauf)

What are the causal effects of changing trading costs on prices? Price reactions arise from both a direct effect and changes
in the stock’s liquidity. The direct impact on prices from trading costs is derived by keeping the
expected returns net of these costs consistent. The liquidity effect operates through the liquidity
risk channel on prices. A decline in a stock’s liquidity diminishes not only its current price but also
heightens expected future returns as compensation for the increase in risk. Leveraging a policy that
allows for an RCT-style causal difference-in-differences analysis for all European stocks, we document
an inverse and asymmetric effect of trading costs on stock prices. Doubling the tick size reduces stock
prices by 0.96% – 1.3%, whereas halving the tick size increases stock prices by 3.3% – 3.5%. We report
evidence of strategic stock price manipulation to increase gains from trade, coupled with behavioral
price dynamics stemming from quote and price clustering.

[Crisis Pricing of Public Firms: Insights from Structural Risk Models]() —

We investigate how financial markets assess a firm’s ability to meet obligations during crises. Our key contribution
is distinguishing between short- and long-term asset-liability mismatches, which allows for a refined
analysis of default risk. We extend traditional structural models by not only treating equity as an
option on firm assets but also modeling stock options as compound options to capture higher moments
of the market-implied risk distribution. While our framework is applicable to all publicly listed firms,
we focus on financial institutions during crisis periods. We derive closed-form solutions that
estimate market expectations regarding short-term deposit outflows, fire sales, interest rate shocks,
and default probabilities on a daily basis.

[Taxing Payments](https://www.amf-france.org/sites/institutionnel/files/private/2022-01/Presentation__Ivar%20Ekeland_0.pdf) —

We propose to add a tax on electronic payments to the existing tax mix. 
We present a model of liquidity management of a firm in
which the treasurer can choose to hold money in a liquid current account and an illiquid investment
account that generates positive returns. All payments arising from commercial activity, both income
and expenses, must go through the current account, and the treasurer has to keep it above zero.
Otherwise, the firm is foreclosed by its creditors. Transferring money from one account to the other
is costly. All payments arising from the firm’s activity, as well as all payments by the treasurer’s
investment decisions, are subject to a payment tax. We derive a closed formula for the treasurer’s
optimal strategy and the elasticity of transfers with respect to the transaction costs and the tax.
Further, we are the first who open the black box of payments and estimate wholesale, retail, FX,
and internalized payments in France and Switzerland. We document a conservative annual payment
volume on the order of 80 to 100 times the country’s GDP.
